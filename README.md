# Fireship app in elm

The YouTube channel _Fireship_ uploaded [a video comparing 10 frontend JavaScript frameworks](https://youtu.be/cuHDQhDhvPE). In that video he developed the same app using the 10 frameworks. It's a good video, I recommend you to watch it.

This little piece of code shows how to develop that app in elm, a delightful language for reliable web applications. **The important file is src/Main.elm**
