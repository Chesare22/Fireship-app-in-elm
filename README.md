# Fireship app in elm

The YouTube channel _Fireship_ uploaded [a video comparing 10 frontend JavaScript frameworks](https://youtu.be/cuHDQhDhvPE). In that video he developed the same app using 10 frameworks. It's a good video, I recommend you to watch it.

But JavaScript frameworks are not the only way to develop a frontend app, there are other alternatives like Elm or Reason ML. I developed the app in Elm if anyone is interested in comparing it with the rest of the Fireship's video. **The important files are _src/Main.elm_ and _src/index.js_**

If you want to learn more about elm, I recommend starting your journey [with this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kuOCx0QeQ5c&list=PLAylyXSffRuJHmLW7FXlh0mp4r6HKafoT&index=10).
